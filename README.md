**beaconid_note.cna** - set Beacon note to its ID on load and initial checkin (primarily useful when coding Aggressor scripts)

**beaconestablishednote.cna** - set Beacon note to the time it was established on initial checkin

**Beaconpire** - send Beacons to Empire and pull Empire Agents into Cobalt Strike

**CCDC** - a collection of scripts designed for use at CCDC
* **lulz.cna** - includes some Blue Team annoyance functions: IE Popup (kiosk mode), Windows Alert (7+), Host Shutdown, Boo.exe (uploads/executes Boo), and Clippy popup (requires setup and Windows 7).

* **sysinternals-killer.cna** - Automatically kill common Blue Team processes, such as the Sysinternals tools, on launch

**checkin_jobs_context.cna** - adds context menu options to run "checkin" or "jobs" on Beacon session to help detect stale beacons in bulk

**eventlog-to-slack.cna** - script to send event log events to Slack. NOTE: Review code before deploying in production. Sensitive information (usernames, hostnames, teamserver IPs) will be sent to Slack.

**forcecheckin.cna** - forces an SMB Beacon to checkin after a specified frequency

**mass-dcsync.cna** - DCSync a line-separated list of users from a DC

**mimikatz-every-30m.cna** - runs mimikatz's "logonpasswords" alias every thirty minutes

**mimikatz-timestamp-note-BETA.cna** - POC script that adds a timestamp to the source column in new credentials. The script is considered BETA - it has not been field tested and has bugs.

**powershell.cna** - adds context items for some common Powerup and Powerview functions. For this to work, you must put the PowerUp.ps1 and powerview.ps1 files in the same directory as this script

**ps-window-alias.cna** - creates an alias to open the process browser pane for the current Beacon

**slack-notify-beacon.cna** - sends a generic alert to a chosen Slack channel via incoming webhook when a new Beacon is established(requires curl on team server)

**slack-notify-webhit.cna** - sends a generic alert to a chosen Slack channel via incoming webhook when a specific URI or URIs are requested (requires curl on team server)

**sleep-down-when-no-operators.cna** - increases the sleep interval on all Beacons when there are no operators logged in

**sleeptimer.cna** - automatically sets sleep intervals based on time (i.e. from 10p to 6a, sleep for 60s). Resets to 60s sleeps when the sleep interval ends.
